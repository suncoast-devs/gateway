      # Congratulations and Welcome Aboard!

      We're excited to tell you that **Suncoast Developers Guild has accepted your application to Cohort #{@cohort.name}**, which begins **#{@cohort.begins_on.to_s(:long_ordinal)}**. We believe you have what it takes to face an incredible commitment and the work it requires to succeed in this course. We're so glad you've decided to join us.

      ## Enrollment

      The next step is reading and [signing the **Student Enrollment Agreement**](#{@program_acceptance.enrollment_agreement_url}). Also, attached to this email is our **Program Catalog**. Please make sure you've read the enrollment agreement _and_ catalog in full.

      A deposit of $1,000 is required to reserve your spot in class while you are securing the remainder of your tuition. You can drop or mail a check to campus or [pay the deposit online](#{@invoice.payment_url}).

      Full payment of tuition or financing completely secured is required by the **Wednesday before class begins** to qualify for enrollment in this cohort. See the Financing section below for details. When you've paid the deposit, your spot in the class is guaranteed. Please make sure to submit that as soon as possible.

      ## Financing

      The remaining tuition payment is payable to Suncoast Developers Guild in full by **#{tuition_due_date.strftime("%A")}, #{tuition_due_date.to_s(:long_ordinal)}**, before the course start date.

      For private financing, we suggest exploring options with companies like [Climb Credit](https://climbcredit.com/suncoast), [LoanWell](https://loanwell.com/code-school/suncoast), and [SkillsFund](https://skills.fund/). These lenders have built loan programs specifically for code schools like ours. Of course, you can also seek lending through your favorite local bank or credit union.
